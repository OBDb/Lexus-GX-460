    description: "The Lexus GX 460 represented the second generation of the GX line, continuing the model's tradition of combining luxury with authentic off-road capability. Based on the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado platform, it featured distinctive Lexus styling with a bold chrome grille (updated to the spindle grille design in later refreshes). Powered by a 4.6-liter V8 engine producing 301 horsepower (later adjusted to 292 hp under revised SAE measurements) and 329 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The standard full-time four-wheel drive system featured a Torsen limited-slip center differential with electronic locking capability and a dual-range transfer case with low-range gearing. Advanced off-road technology included Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) that could automatically disconnect stabilizer bars for improved wheel articulation, Crawl Control for low-speed off-road navigation, and Downhill Assist Control. The interior offered three rows of seating for seven passengers, wrapped in premium leather with mahogany wood trim and a comprehensive suite of luxury amenities. Early models featured a touchscreen infotainment system with available navigation, later updated to larger screens with enhanced functionality throughout the generation. A significant refresh in 2014 introduced the spindle grille design and added new safety and technology features. Another substantial update in 2020 brought even more distinctive styling with a massive spindle grille, triple-beam LED headlights, and a redesigned rear end with updated taillights. Safety technology evolved throughout the generation, culminating in the standard Lexus Safety System+ suite including pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert, intelligent high beams, and high-speed dynamic radar cruise control. Despite minimal mechanical changes throughout its unusually long 14-year production run, the GX 460 maintained a loyal following for its combination of luxury, reliability, and authentic off-road capability increasingly rare in the luxury SUV segment."
