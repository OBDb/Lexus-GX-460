    description: "The Lexus GX 460 represented the second generation of the GX line, continuing the model's tradition of combining luxury with authentic off-road capability. Based on the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado platform (Toyota F2 chassis), it featured distinctive Lexus styling with a bold chrome vertical grille. Powered by a 4.6-liter 1UR-FE V8 engine producing 301 horsepower and 329 lb-ft of torque, paired with a six-speed A760F automatic transmission. The standard full-time four-wheel drive system featured a Torsen limited-slip center differential with electronic locking capability and a dual-range transfer case with low-range gearing. Advanced off-road technology included Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) that could automatically disconnect stabilizer bars for improved wheel articulation, Crawl Control for low-speed off-road navigation, and Downhill Assist Control. The interior offered three rows of seating for seven passengers with a power-folding third row, wrapped in premium leather with wood trim and a comprehensive suite of luxury amenities including a Mark Levinson sound system and Rear Seat Entertainment System. Safety features included ten airbags, Pre-Collision System, Driver Monitoring System, and lane departure warning system. The first model year (2010) received a 'Don't buy, Safety Risk' rating from Consumer Reports due to slow VSC response, which was resolved with a software recall in April 2010."

The GX 460 maintained its body-on-frame construction and off-road capability while updating its visual identity to align with Lexus' new design language. In China, the GX 400 variant with a 4.0-liter V6 engine was offered from 2012-2017 as a lower displacement option."
